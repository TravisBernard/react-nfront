# react-nfront 

## What is this package?

To be honest, I don't know yet but I have this idea.  There's a movement in frontend development right now called the [micro-frontend](https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html).  But what if we could build our frontend applications out of even smaller, even more reusable pieces.  What if there were nano-frontends.  That's what this package is about â€“ to see if nano-frontends make sense and work.
